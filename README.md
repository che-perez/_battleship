# Battleship
This is a battleship app for the web. Created as part of an exercise in chapter 8 of Head First JavaScript Programing by Freeman & Robson.
For the creation of this app we implemented, functions, objects, methods, the control and manipulation of the DOM and others.
By the end of the project I decided to add a few customizations of my own, but for those you gotta play and listen.
